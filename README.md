# "Pracital session on "Beyond Genome-wide Association Studies"
## What this session is about?
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple genetic variants  associated with complex traits, many efforts have shown that a sizeable fraction of the genetics explaining the pheotypic variance. With the recent trend of making these summary measures publicly available it has opened new venues to test overlap between these complex traits from the genetics standpoint. In this session, we will explore some of the follow-ups strategy to infer some biological evidence from otherwise purely statistical signals. 
## What you need?
To avoid any possible delays/hiccups in running the analysis from a command line (which is the ideal way anyways!!). 
This DIY session instead will use Jypternotebook (web interface) in running the analysis. By this means, participants can focus more on the analysis (then troubleshooting or setting things up)  
## Requirements:
1. Docker software (that creates a VM machine)
2. Docker image file (that contains all the necessary files to run the analysis), it is a gzipped (*.gz) file and can be downloaded through the following google drive link
# Strongly advise to download this docker image file, prior to the session!!!

## Installing docker:
For mac:
This should be a straightforward installation (https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg)
for more info: https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac
After installing;
Open a command-line terminal, and try out some Docker commands.

    Run docker version to check that you have the latest release installed.

    Run docker run hello-world to verify that Docker is pulling images and running as expected.
